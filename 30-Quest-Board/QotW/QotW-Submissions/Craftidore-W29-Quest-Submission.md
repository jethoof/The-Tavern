> [!summary] Quest of the Missing Bull
> Quest on the quest board: rancher Oliver House needs help wrangling escaped cow. 
> 
> Actual situation: A bull escaped in the night and Oliver House doesn't know where to find it. Tracks lead away from the ranch toward the town. 
> - If Oliver is asked for details about the bull's habits, he mentions that he's had a particular liking for Lee Hurst's cow.
> - A successful tracking-or-equivalent check reveals that the tracks veer off toward a nearby ranch (Lee Hurst's ranch)
> - If the PCs ask around town, the one guy mentions that as he was leaving town he saw a bull heading to the west (which if they ask further is toward the Lee Hurst's ranch and Ernest Carr's ranch).
> 
> When the bull is found, it's caused damage to Lee's house and such. Lee demands Oliver pay for the damages (the cost he cites is equivalent to however much the PCs are getting paid) or get someone to repair it, and stops the PCs from taking the bull (which is now trapped in the fenced-in area of his ranch) until the damage is repaired or he is otherwise compensated.
> Oliver, of course, refuses to fork over any money, and repeats that what he hired the PCs for was retrieving the cow, and they've not done that..
